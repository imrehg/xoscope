xoscope - Digital Oscilloscope via Sound Card/COMEDI

Latest official version and more is available at:

		http://xoscope.sourceforge.net/


	SUMMARY:

xoscope is a digital oscilloscope that uses a sound card (via ALSA or
EsounD) and/or a data acquisition card (via COMEDI) as the signal
input.

	WHAT YOU NEED:

A modern Linux distribution should be able to build xoscope from
source.

* You will need GTK+ 2 (version 2.18 or newer).

* You will need the gtkdatabox library.  For best visual results, you
  may wish to use the version from the xoscope git repository.

* You will need the fftw library.

* You will need (optionally) the ALSA, ESD, or COMEDI libraries.  If
  any (or all) of these libraries are absent, xoscope will build
  without that library's input capability.


	INSTALLATION:

* ./configure

* make

* make install


	USAGE:

Please see the man page for instructions on how to use xoscope.  Also
use the option `-h' to show command-line options, and the `?' key to
show the key help.  If you're interested in doing advanced signal math
at run-time, see the Perl function help under the Channel/Math menu.


	EXTRA:

If you like to build things, the hardware/ directory contains plans
for a buffer circuit to interface electronics to a sound card.
