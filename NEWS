	NEW for 2.2	Released September 2016
	===========	=======================

* AppStream support


	NEW for 2.1	Released January 2015
	===========	=====================

* ALSA soundcard support

* Perl functions now supported again

* Bitscope support dropped due to its proprietary interface


	NEW for 2.0	Released June 2009
	===========	==================

* Completely X Windows / GTK 2.0 based

* Ability to scroll a signal too wide to fit on the screen


	NEW for 1.10	Released June 2003
	============	==================

* COMEDI support - http://www.comedi.org/

* Ability to use parallel port for digital data collection

* Improved performance under X Windows

* More modular data source interface


	NEW for 1.8	Released May 2001
	===========	=================

* Standard GNU-style `./configure ; make' automated build process.

* Samples are now collected in parallel to display refresh for audio
  and bitscope devices.

* This has enabled much longer sweep times: up to 2 sec/division!

* Memory buffers increased to 256K to support such slow sweeps.
  Memories now store time zero to current display point and file
  length is as long as longest memory.

* New step display mode, hit the ! key.

* Under GTK, mouse cursors are now draggable while left button
  decreases and middle button increases the variable pointed to.
  Right menu still pops up the context-sensitive menu.

* Basic limited bitscope data capture at a fixed sample rate.  If a
  BitScope is identified, it is used exclusively, turning off sound
  and ProbeScope input devices.  It connects BitScope Channel A, B and
  LA to X, Y and Z respectively.


	NEW for 1.7	Released June 2000
	===========	==================

* Logic Analyzer display mode.  Instead of drawing one analog line,
  multiple digital bit lines are drawn.  Hit ` or ~ to decrease or
  increase the number of bits shown.

* Manually-positioned measurement cursors.  Hit ' to turn them on, "
  to reset them, and Ctrl-d/f/e/r to move them.  Under GTK+, left
  click positions one cursor and middle click sets the other.  Right
  click always brings up the context-sensitive menu.


	NEW for 1.6	Released March 2000
	===========	===================

* EsounD (Enlightened Sound Daemon) support.  Esd is common with Gnome
  and allows xoscope to share a sound device with other programs or
  across a network.  So xoscope can now see your MP3s playing on xmms!

* GTK+ 1.2 or better is now required to build the xoscope X11 client:

  + Oft-used menus can be "torn-off" and kept available.

  + Context-sensitive pop-up menus for selecting channel, scale,
    position, memory store and recall, plot mode, trigger, etc.


	NEW for 1.5	Released August 1999
	===========	====================

* GTK+ support for building the xoscope X11 client

	+ This release supports 1.0 now but future versions will
	  require 1.2 or higher.  You can ignore the menu_factory
	  warning if you build with 1.2+.  This warning will go away
	  in 1.6 and is why GTK+ 1.2 will then be required.

	+ keyboard interface works as in all other interfaces

	+ nearly everything is also available from the menubar

	+ double buffered display (no loss if you cover it up)

	+ xoscope will build with GTK+ (default) *or* libsx, see Makefile

* Bug Fixes / Enhancements

	+ sound card sample rates fixed (i.e. 44100, not 44000).

	+ smarter more correct sound card buffer flushing and syncing

	+ this results in a faster refresh rate in real-time

	+ new frame per second display shows actual refresh rate

* New example data files to load or look at

	+ audio.dat: good for watching stereo audio

	+ proscope.dat: good for using ProbeScope/osziFOX

	+ oscope.dat: default settings, good for resetting


	NEW for 1.4	Released June 1997
	===========	==================

* Supports Radio Shack's ProbeScope as an input device!

	+ auto-detected, see ENVIRONMENT in the man page.

	+ increased time scale: 1us/div - 20ms/div

	+ real V/div vertical scale labels.

	+ displays all ProbeScope status and DVM value

* DOS port finally works

	+ All ProbeScope support works on DOS.

	- mono sound support only so X = Y; no Left and Right.

	- external math commands don't work since DOS doesn't fork


	NEW for 1.3	Released May 1997
	===========	=================

* sample rate can be changed independent of horizontal scale.

* signals of any sample rate can now be stored and recalled.

* you can zoom out further to see more time (skip samples).

* math functions can now operate on memory buffers.

* display and controls rearranged slightly; a button for xy.

* the code is more modular for easier porting, see TODO #24.

* unfinished DOS (DJGPP/GRX) port is included, see TODO #24.


	NEW for 1.2	Released October 1996
	===========	=====================

* !!! At least 2X faster (inefficient display loop fixed) !!!

* average math function fixed; it didn't work in 1.2.

* single shot mode; show the first set of samples after trigger.

* xy external command for xoscope; show xy in another window.

* cleaner easier to read display; hit ? to toggle the help screen.

* buff2.*, pcb.*; exact layout of the circuit described in HARDWARE.
