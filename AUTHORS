Recent work (since release 1.10) by Brent Baccala <cosine@freesoft.org>

Oscope/Xoscope was written by Tim Witham <twitham@quiknet.com>, known
as <twitham@pcocd2.intel.com> back in 1995 when development began.

Oscope was originally based on "scope" by Jeff Tranter
<Jeff_Tranter@Mitel.COM>.  Oscope is released under the conditions of
the GNU General Public License.  See the files README and COPYING in
the distribution for details.
